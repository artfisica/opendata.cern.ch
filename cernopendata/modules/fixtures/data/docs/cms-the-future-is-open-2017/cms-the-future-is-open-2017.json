        "content": "In November 2014, the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) released the first batch of research-grade data from the 2010 proton-proton collision run. This was an unprecedented move in the field of particle physics, since up until this point, access to data from hadron colliders was restricted to members of the experimental collaborations."
