As of today, the OPERA Collaboration has released the first set of its data samples for the Open Data Portal.

The OPERA experiment has been searching for neutrino oscillations, i.e. the transmutation of muon neutrinos into tau neutrinos along their flight from CERN to the INFN Gran Sasso laboratory (Italy) where they are caught. Five tau neutrino candidates were reported in 2015, thus proving unambiguously the transmutation. While searching for tau neutrinos, the Collaboration has deeply studied the interactions of muon neutrinos.

The data set released today by the Collaboration is indeed a study of the muon neutrino interactions with a sub-sample of data where all the tracks produced by the impact of neutrinos with the lead target have been studied and classified.
